# ipynb Directory

This directory contains a sample Jupyter notebook to illustrate how spreadsheets (exported as CSV files) containing (1) the coordinates of 
the SVG "wireframe"for the data visualization of a particular route, and (2) Bill Kuttner's balanced volume data for that route can be joined
(on the 'data_id' field) and the exported as a CSV to be read by the data visualization code.
