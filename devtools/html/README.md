# html

This directory contains HTML files to generate 'wireframe' visualizations of EB-WB and NB-SB routes.
These files are used to develop/debug the SVG x1, y1, x2, and y2 coordinates for the SVG <line> elements that comprise these visualizations.

These HTML files depend upon the d3.js and lodash.js libraries to run the JavaScript code they contain.
It is the user's responsibility to provide these libraries.
